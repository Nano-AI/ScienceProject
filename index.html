      <h1>Newton's First Law</h1>
      <hr>
      <h2>About the First Law</h2>
      <p>
        According to 
        <a href="https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/newton1g.html#:~:text=His%20first%20law%20states%20that,action%20of%20an%20external%20force.&text=The%20amount%20of%20the%20change,Newton's%20second%20law%20of%20motion.">NASA's Website</a>,
        the first law says that "<strong>Every object persists in its state of rest or uniform motion in a straight line
        unless it is compelled to change that state by forces impressed on it.</strong>".<br>
        In basic terms, <strong>an object will stay at rest or go in one direction unless another force is acted upon it</strong>.
        An example could be a still soccer ball. It's going to stay still unless some other force acts upon it. An example of an external
        force could be my leg. When I kick it, it's going to change the direction of movement.

      <h3 class="">Why should you get it?</h3>
      <p>There are many reasons why you should get it, but here's a few:</p>
      <h4 class="text-success">You can move around (and break dance)</h4>
      <p>
        If you couldn't break dance before, well you can now with Newton's first law.<br>
        With Newton's law, you can finally break dance.
        When you swing your feet outward, your feet are going to start  
        to swing in rotation to the body because of Newton's first law. 
        The feet will remain in motion until the body rotates and slows down.

      <img src="./images/head_smack.gif" class="float-right" style="width: 150px;">
      <h4 class="text-success">Objects don't move randomly</h4>
      <div>
        <p>
          Objects need a force to be acted upon them in order to move, so that means that they don't just move randomly without anything acting upon it.
          An example would be say a ball. It's going to stay still unless an external force is acted upon it, this means that the ball can't just start moving
          randomly by itself.
          (It means no random objects hitting you in the head!)
        </p>
      </div>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h4 class="text-success">You can move objects around</h4>
      <img src="./images/legos.png" class="float-right" width="100">
      <p>
        With Newton's first law, you can move objects around. Like say for example Legos.
        Without Newton's first law, even if you apply force onto it, you can't move. 
        So Newton's first law comes in handy when you want to move objects and make structures.
        Another example could be sports, you can kick/punt/shoot the ball and change the direction of its movement.
        Newton's law finally makes playing Legos (or do anything else that requires you do move objects) fun for the whole family.
        In a real word situation, you can actually move things around, say you wanted to move wood to make a house, you could do that.
      </p>
      <br><br>
      <h4 class="text-success"><span class="color-changing">BONUS:</span> You can use vehicles!</h4>
      <p>
        With Newton's first law, you can make flying vehicles. This includes cars, planes, rockets, boats, and everything in between!
        Say for example a rocket. The rocket is going to stay at rest at the start because there's not force being acted upon it.
        So that means that it will stay still before launch. But once the rocket fires up it's thrusters, the burning fuel
        will push the rocket, and here's where the first law comes in. The rocket is going to start moving because an external force (the engines)
        is acting upon the rocket.

          <h4>We aren't responsible for any damage caused by Newton's first law of motion</h4>
          <h6 class="text-danger">It requires energy which can become costly and bad for the environment</h6>
            <p>
              Changing the state of an object requires energy, and depending on what you're trying to move it, and how,
              it can use up a lot of money which will take money to produce. Not only that,
              some methods of generating energy are harmful to the environment.<br>
              Some examples are:
              <ul class="list-group">
                <ul>- Oil</ul>
                <ul>- Gas</ul>
                <ul>- Nuclear Fuel</ul>
                <ul>- Etc.</ul>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <h6 class="text-danger">People can hurt themselves (including you)</h4>
            <p>
              You can injure yourself in many ways. Newton's first law <strong>could</strong> be part of the reason. An example would be
              say you're going down a hill really fast on roller blades, you can't stop yourself, because according to Newton's first law,
              you need an external force to stop you. So you can't stop yourself, and you're probably going to injure yourself. 
              Not only that people can hurt other people. Like say with a rock, they can change the direction it was traveling to you instead.<br>
              This isn't limited to rocks, and roller blades. Car crashes are also an issue. 
              When a car crashes, there is no unbalanced force acting on the person, so they continue forward (because according to Newton's first law, an object will go in one direction unless external force is exerted on it). 
              Then the person moves against the seat belt hence exerting a force on it. If a person isn't wearing a seat belt, they're going to go end up
              flying into the wind shield. There are still tons of other things that can harm you, these are just a few.<br>
              Not only that, the harm can be done in mass scales, like say in wars.
            </p>
            <h6 class="text-danger">Animals can be hurt/killed too</h4>
            <p>
              Animals can be hurt and killed too. One example of how they could be killed is via a gun. A gun uses bullets, and bullets move 
              using mini-explosions (form the gunpowder) that change the direction in which the bullet moves.
